Welcome to the SQL and Relational Database 101 Course Summary!
You've covered the five modules in this course.
You've learned that a relational database stores data in tabular form, with relationships
between tables.
Relational database management systems are the backbone of applications in many industries
including banking, transportation, and healthcare.
You can now explain that an Information Model is conceptual, defining relationships between
objects, that a Data Model is specific, includes details, and is the blueprint of any database
system, and that a Relational Model is the most used data model for databases because
it allows for data independence.
You can now discuss Entity-Relationship diagrams, relationships, how the ER diagram relates
into a relational database table, and you can list the six types of Relational Model
Constraints.
We learned that for the majority of people using a database, there are 5 simple commands,
and you can now identify examples of the syntax of these commands.
In addition, you can list some advanced techniques in retrieving data from a relational table
using string patterns, ranges or sets of values, and how to sort or group the result set.
Finally, you can now explain how to combine data from two or more tables to create a result
set using the JOIN operator, and list the different types of join operators, especially
the most common type: the INNER JOIN.
You've worked your way through all five modules, the review questions, and the four hands-on
labs that gave you the chance to try out the concepts for yourself.
Now you're ready to take the 15 questions final exam.
