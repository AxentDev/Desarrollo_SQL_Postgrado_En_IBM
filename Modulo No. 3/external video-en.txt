Welcome to Types of SQL Statements.
At the end of the video, you will be able to distinguish between data definition language
statements and data manipulation language statements.
SQL Statements are used for interacting with Entities (that is, tables),
Attributes (that is, columns) and their tuples (or rows with data values) in relational databases.
SQL statements fall into two different categories:
Data Definition Language statements and Data Manipulation Language statements.
Data Definition Language (or DDL) statements are used to define, change, or drop database
objects such as tables.
Common DDL statement types include CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, and DROP.
CREATE: which is used for creating tables and defining its columns;
ALTER: is used for altering tables including adding and dropping columns and modifying
their datatypes;
TRUNCATE: is used for deleting data in a table but not the table itself;
DROP: is used for deleting tables.
Data Manipulation Language (or DML) statements are used to read and modify data in tables.
These are also sometimes referred to as CRUD operations,
that is, Create, Read, Update and Delete rows in a table.
Common DML statement types include INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
INSERT: is used for inserting a row or several rows of data into a table;
SELECT: reads or selects row or rows from a table;
UPDATE: edits row or rows in a table;
And DELETE: removes a row or rows of data from a table.
Now you know that:
DDL or Data Definition Language statements are used for defining or changing objects
in a database such as tables.
And DML or Data Manipulation Language statements are used for manipulating or working with
data in tables.
